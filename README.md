# Pacific Battle!

## WWII Pacific Campaign Simulation
### Unity 3D Boardgame
 
*Turn-based strategy board game using unit tiles for military organization and dice-based combat resolution (calculated random results).*
*Based on real historical conditions, player chooses to play US/Allies or Japan, commanding an actual historic naval fleet.*
*Player can compete against a computer AI, or another player via a web connection.*
*Objective is to gain the most "points" over 9 turns by controlling various sea areas and bases with various weighted values.*

### Vision:
- 3-D Perspective or Isometric view of a rotatable board with ships/units represented by 3-D tiles, or more realistic assets. 
- Each board area will have a more detailed close-up map to zoom in on for combat organization and battles. 
- Various modals and integrated utility windows will display game state and info,  
  and enable data analysis, strategizing, inventory management, and ultimately guide overall game-play. 
- Game will feature sound effects, mutable background music, particles, and victory/defeat cinematic animations.
- Game will retain state information allowing Save operations and ability to Resume at a later time.
- Player vs. Computer will have unlimited time to complete turns,  
  but Player vs. Player will timeout after a period of time to avoid abandonment of games.
